# HunterJohnsonPortfolioSite
Technologies used to complete this site were a CSS Grid generator 
https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/ that was implemented on the 
homepage for the portfolio highlight section along with GitHub Desktop 
to host the site and Visual Studio Code to code the site. I also used 
Photoshop and Preview to edit the resolution and size of my images and 
create thumbnails for others. I used w3schools for my image css grids 
on my portfolio subpages and detail pages along with my two navbars that 
I have implemented for mobile and desktop. I used another site for my line 
hover animations but I believe it has been taken down since I utilized it for 
my site. To my knowledge it was on Code Pen.

There have been many revisions that went into this site starting from the 
fact I started on a site builder. Then I tried recreating a prototype for 
it in Adobe XD and then totally redesigned it to feel more graphic design 
based and feel more like it reflects me as a person. And I made a lot of 
revisions especially towards the three portfolio sub-pages. I started by 
using a lot of hyperlinks and mockup thumbnails but then I had an idea to 
create a mosaic css image grid and I'm really pleased with how it looks on 
desktop (mobile too but mobile only has one column rather than the multiple 
columns that desktop has). Throughout the whole process I was sending the 
website's link to my friends and having them give me feedback and so I was 
making revisions throughout the whole process.
